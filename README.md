## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Chaojie Zhu** from Shanghai, China. I'm curious and passionate about entertainment technologies, such as AR/VR and game AI.

I'm currently located in Sunnyvale, CA, and working as an AR/VR Software Engineer @ Apple. Before Apple, I graduated from CMU with a Master of Entertainment Technology degree and interned at Uber Advanced Technology Group, working with self-driving vehicles.

## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there 

Iâ€™m a software engineer at Apple, worked on RealityKit for iOS and visionOS and now working on a special project. I contributed to bringing up the first generation of Apple Vision Pro.

Iâ€™m passionate about building technologies that empower human behavior, including simulation, AI, and robotics. With a background in game engines, I love crafting interactive and immersive experiences that bridge the digital and physical worlds. Iâ€™m always exploring new ways to push the boundaries of innovation and human-computer interaction.
